# UFO
## Overview of Project
A project request was made to create a website with a table that allows for indepth analysis of UFO sightings. The table needed to allow users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition, the table needed to be able to filter by date, city, state, county and shape. 
- Deliverable 1: Filter UFO sightings on multiple criteria
- Deliverable 2: A written report on the UFO analysis (README.md)
## Results
As requested an interative website with a table was created using data with the following columns: date, city, state, country, shape, duration, and comments of the event. Users are able to search and filter the table by one cretieria items or my several. Users name search criteria in the white boxes and click the filter table button.

## Summary 
One drawback of the webpage is that information is only current up to the point that the data was uploaded. If current data could be pulled as created by the sources the data came from it would be a more powerful resource. Future recommendataions inlcude adding this live data piece, if possiable, and information for users regarding where they could go to learn more.
